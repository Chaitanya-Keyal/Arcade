TCP Server Documentation

The Server runs on channels.

1. Main Channel (0): Behaves somewhat like a REST API. The client sends requests for listing other channels, joining and creating new channels and so on.

2. Lobby Channels: Capable of receiving messages from all and broadcasting to its members.
   
3. Room Channels: Requires a host. Only members can send messages.
