Server Documentation

The Server runs on channels.

1. Main Channel (0..0): Behaves somewhat like a REST API. The client sends requests for listing other channels, joining and creating new channels and so on. 

2. Lobby Channels : Capable of receiving messages from all and broadcasting to its members.
    
3. Room Channels : Requires a host. Only members can send messages.


Format of messages:
